        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Easy Org Chart (the "App"), which operates as a Google Workspace Add-On, handles your data. Importantly, the App does not transmit any user data externally and operates solely within the Google Workspace environment.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data of its users. All operations and data processing occur within the user's instance of Google Workspace, and no data is shared with third-party services or the App developers.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>As the App does not collect or store any data, there are no data storage facilities or databases associated with it. User data remains within their Google Workspace environment and is subject to Google's own security measures.</p>

        <h2>User Consent</h2>
        <p>By using Easy Org Chart, you consent to this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the App following any changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>Although most changes likely to be minor, Easy Org Chart may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Users are encouraged to check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.</p>
